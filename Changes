Revision history for Perl extension Math::Prime::Util.

0.02  4 June 2012
    - Back off new_ok to new/isa_ok to keep Test::More requirements low.
    - Some documentation updates.
    - I accidently used long in SQUFOF, which breaks LLP64.
    - Test for broken 64-bit Perl.
    - Fix overflow issues in segmented sieving.
    - Switch to using UVuf for croaks.  What I should have done all along.
    - prime_count uses a segment sieve with 256k chunks (~7.9M numbers).
      Not memory intensive any more, and faster for large inputs.  The time
      growth is slightly over linear however, so expect to wait a long
      time for 10^12 or more.
