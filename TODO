- Examine behavior near 32-bit limit on 32-bit machines.
  (done for factoring)

- GMP versions of all routines.

- segment sieve should itself use a segment for its primes.
  Today we'd need sqrt(2^64) max = 140MB.  Segmenting would yield under 1MB.

- Add test to check maxbits in compiled library vs. Perl

- Figure out documentation solution for PP.pm

- Is the current PP.pm setup the way we want to do it?

- input validation (in XS, or do we need to make Perl wrappers for everything?)
  We can do input val in XS by looking at the NV.  But I think long term we'll
  have a little Perl front end for everything to route to bignum routines or
  regular routines.

- Faster SQUFOF

- better prime count upper/lower bounds (under RH for 64-bit).

- Move .c / .h files into separate directory.
  version does it in a painful way.  Something simpler to be had?

- finish test suite for bignum.  Work on making it faster.

- need next_prime and prev_prime bignum support.  random_ndigit_prime needs it.

- Need to add more bignum factoring support:
   - GMP prho
   - GMP pminus1
   - GMP SQUFOF
   - GMP tinyqs
  The first three should give us reasonable support up to ~30 digits.  Adding
  a tinyQS (e.g. yafu, msieve, flint) would both be faster and extend to ~40
  digits (in a reasonable time).  Going beyong that is going to need full
  MPQS or SIQS.  Another possibility is to see if the GMP-ECM library is
  installed and call that, but I'm not sure how much it will help if we get
  the above running.

- Tune the Lucas sequence code, especially try using more BigInt features.

- Add tests for strong lucas pseudoprime, perhaps export the function
